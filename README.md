## ✨ What it does

- Packages the Jellyfin Orsay widget
- Runs a local web server for TV installation
- Automatically generates `widgetlist.xml`
- Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**
- Multi-language UI

---

## 📺 How to use

1. Enable **Developer Mode** on your Samsung TV (see below)
2. Start the installer
3. Note the **PC IP address** shown in the app
4. Click **Build & Start**
5. On the TV: **Apps → Sync**

That’s it.

---

## 🛠️ Enable Developer Mode (Samsung Orsay TVs)

To install community apps on Samsung **Orsay-based Smart TVs (2011–2015)**, Developer Mode must be enabled.

### 1️⃣ Log in as developer

1. Open **Smart Hub** on the TV  
2. Press the **RED** button on the remote to open the login screen  
3. Log in with:
   - **Username:** `develop`
   - **Password:** `000000`  
     *(On some models the password may be empty)*

---

### 2️⃣ Open Developer Settings

After logging in as `develop`:

- Press the **BLUE** button on the Smart Hub screen  
  **or**
- Open **Tools → Settings** (model dependent)

This opens the **Developer Menu**.

---

### 3️⃣ Set the Server IP

In the Developer Menu:

1. Select **Setting Server IP**
2. Enter the **IP address shown in the installer**
3. Confirm and save

This tells the TV where to fetch the widget from.

---

### 4️⃣ Sync User Applications

Still in the Developer Menu:

1. Select **User Application Synchronization**
2. Wait for the sync to complete

The Jellyfin app will now appear in Smart Hub.

---

### ℹ️ Notes

- These steps apply to **Orsay TVs only** (roughly 2011–2015)
- Menu names may vary slightly by firmware version
- Newer Samsung TVs using **Tizen** are **not supported**

Developer mode instructions are based on the Samsung Orsay community documentation:

---

## 🛡️ Antivirus warning

Some antivirus tools (including Windows Defender) may flag the installer as suspicious.  
This is a **false positive**, common for self-contained installers.

You can verify integrity using the provided **SHA256 checksum** in the release assets.
